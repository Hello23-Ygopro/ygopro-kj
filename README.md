</p>

## How to play
1. Start YGOPro.
2. Click on `Deck Management` to build your deck. Remember to add 1 _Kaijudo Rules_!<br>
3. At the start of the game, take 5 cards from the top of your deck without [looking](https://duelmasters.fandom.com/wiki/Look) at them and put them in a row in front of you face down. These face down cards are your [shields](https://kaijudo.wikia.com/wiki/Shield). (You can only have a maximum of 5 shields in YGOPro.) Then [draw](https://kaijudo.fandom.com/wiki/Draw) 5 cards. There is no limit to the number of cards you can have in your hand.
4. During your Beginning Phase, [untap](https://kaijudo.fandom.com/wiki/Tap_(Untap)) all your [tapped](https://kaijudo.fandom.com/wiki/Tap_(Untap)) creatures in the [battle zone](https://kaijudo.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_Zone) and tapped cards in your [mana zone](https://kaijudo.fandom.com/wiki/Mana_Zone). Then draw 1 card. The person who plays first skips drawing a card on their first turn.
5. During your Mana Phase, you can put a card from your hand into your mana zone. There is no limit to the number of cards you can have in your mana zone.
6. During your Main Phase, you can [play](https://duelmasters.fandom.com/wiki/Play) as many [creatures](https://kaijudo.fandom.com/wiki/Creature) and [spells](https://kaijudo.fandom.com/wiki/Shield) as your mana zone can afford. You can play any card in any order. (You can only have a maximum of 6 creatures in YGOPro.)
7. During your Attack Phase, you can [attack](https://kaijudo.fandom.com/wiki/Attack) with your creatures in the battle zone by tapping them and declaring what you want to attack. You cannot attack with creatures you just put into the battle zone this turn because they have [summoning sickness](https://kaijudo.fandom.com/wiki/Summon). There is no limit to the number of times a creature can attack each turn as long as it is untapped and you can tap it.
8. During your End Phase, resolve any [abilities](https://kaijudo.fandom.com/wiki/Card_Abilities) that trigger "at the end of your turn". Then your turn ends.

**Important:**
1. This YGOPro game is only compatible with the Microsoft Windows operating system.
2. Online play is not supported.
3. At least 1 player must have _Kaijudo Rules_ in their deck, otherwise the mod will not function properly.
4. YGOPro does not allow you to look at a tapped card in your opponent's mana zone that was put there from a [Private Zone](https://duelmasters.fandom.com/wiki/Private_Zone). You will be able to look at it when it untaps, or is put into a [Public Zone](https://duelmasters.fandom.com/wiki/Public_Zone).

## How to win
1. Attack your opponent with a creature that is not [blocked](https://kaijudo.fandom.com/wiki/Block) or removed when they have no shields left.
2. When your opponent has no cards left in their deck or they would draw their last card.
3. [Some cards](https://kaijudo.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mystic_of_Light) will enable you to win the game via their effects.
